Here is the comprehensive plan for converting the React web app into an APK using Expo:

### Information Gathered:
- The project is a React application with dependencies on `expo-cli` and `react-native`, indicating it is set up for mobile development.
- The `app.json` file contains essential configuration details, including the app name, version, orientation, icons, splash screen, and Android-specific settings.

### Plan:
1. **Install Expo CLI**: Ensure that the Expo CLI is installed globally on your machine. This can be done using the command:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. **Initialize Expo Project**: If not already done, initialize the Expo project using the existing React app. This can be done by running:
   ```bash
   expo init
   ```

3. **Configure App.json**: Ensure that the `app.json` file is correctly configured with the necessary details for Android, including the package name and icons.

4. **Build the APK**: Use the Expo Application Services (EAS) to build the APK. This can be done by running:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android
   ```

5. **Install EAS CLI**: If you haven't already, install the EAS CLI to manage builds:
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

6. **Follow Build Instructions**: Follow any additional instructions provided by Expo during the build process, including setting up credentials if required.

7. **Test the APK**: Once the build is complete, download the APK and test it on an Android device.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured.
- Test the application thoroughly on an Android device to ensure functionality.
