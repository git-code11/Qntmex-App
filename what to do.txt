Here is what i need you to do now, so here is the plan i got fron gpt that you need to follow or pick ideas of what need to be done.

I want to convert this app into apk

GPT: Yes, Expo can help you convert your React-based crypto wallet app into an APK. Expo is a framework for building React Native apps that supports both iOS and Android. You can use Expo EAS (Expo Application Services) Build to generate an APK without needing Android Studio. 

 Steps to Convert Your App to an APK with Expo:
1. **Install Expo CLI**
   Run this command in your terminal to install Expo globally:
   ```sh
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. **Initialize Your Project**
   If your app is not yet a React Native project, create a new one:
   ```sh
   expo init my-crypto-wallet
   ```
   Otherwise, navigate to your existing project.

3. **Login to Expo**
   ```sh
   expo login
   ```
   If you donâ€™t have an Expo account, create one at [Expo Dev](https://expo.dev/).

4. **Install EAS CLI**
   ```sh
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

5. **Configure EAS**
   Run:
   ```sh
   eas build:configure
   ```
   This will set up the necessary files for Expo to handle the build.

6. **Build the APK**
   Run:
   ```sh
   eas build -p android --profile preview
   ```
   This will generate an APK for testing. If you want a **Play Store-ready APK**, use:
   ```sh
   eas build -p android --profile production
   ```

7. **Download the APK**
   After the build is completed, Expo will provide a link to download your APK.
